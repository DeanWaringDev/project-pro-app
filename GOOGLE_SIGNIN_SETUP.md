# Google Sign-In Setup Guide

## Current Implementation Status
✅ Google Sign-In has been implemented in the AuthScreen component
✅ Firebase Google Auth Provider is configured
✅ Works on web platform out of the box
⚠️ Additional configuration needed for mobile platforms

## How it Works

### Web Platform
- Uses Firebase Auth with Google provider
- Popup-based authentication (with redirect fallback)
- No additional configuration needed

### Mobile Platforms (iOS/Android)
The current implementation will work for mobile, but requires additional Firebase project configuration:

## Required Firebase Console Setup

### 1. Add OAuth Client IDs
In your Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/):

1. Go to your project
2. Navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method
3. Enable Google sign-in provider
4. Add your app's client IDs:
   - Web client ID (already configured)
   - Android OAuth client ID
   - iOS OAuth client ID

### 2. Update google-services.json (Android)
Your current `google-services.json` file needs OAuth client configuration:

```json
{
  "oauth_client": [
    {
      "client_id": "YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID",
      "client_type": 1,
      "android_info": {
        "package_name": "com.deanwaringdev.projectpro",
        "certificate_hash": "SHA1_CERTIFICATE_HASH"
      }
    },
    {
      "client_id": "YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID",
      "client_type": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Add GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS)
Download from Firebase Console and add to your iOS project.

## Testing the Implementation

### Web Testing
1. Run `npm start`
2. Open in web browser
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Should open Google sign-in popup

### Mobile Testing
After adding OAuth client configuration:
1. Build for mobile platform
2. Test Google sign-in button
3. Should open Google authentication flow

## Current Features
- ✅ Google sign-in button with Google logo
- ✅ Proper error handling for various scenarios
- ✅ Loading states during authentication
- ✅ Popup blocked detection and redirect fallback
- ✅ Cross-platform support (web/mobile)
- ✅ Integration with existing Firebase auth flow

## Error Handling
The implementation handles these common scenarios:
- Popup blocked by browser
- User cancels sign-in
- Network errors
- Account conflicts
- Authentication failures

## Next Steps
1. Configure OAuth clients in Firebase Console
2. Update google-services.json with OAuth client IDs
3. Add GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS
4. Test on actual mobile devices
